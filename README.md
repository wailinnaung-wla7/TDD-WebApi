# TDD-WebApi
# Project Overview


This repository demonstrates the implementation of a minimal Web API project in .NET 6, adhering to Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles. It utilizes HttpClient for making external requests and embraces Dependency Injection (DI) and Inversion of Control (IoC) patterns for loose coupling and enhanced maintainability. The project adheres to SOLID design principles to ensure code clarity, flexibility, and maintainability.

# Key Technologies
Web API Development: Building a RESTful API using ASP.NET Core, enabling communication between applications and data sources.

TDD (Test-Driven Development): A software development methodology that prioritizes writing tests before implementing code, ensuring functionality and quality.

Unit Testing: Employing unit tests to isolate and test individual components of the codebase, ensuring their correctness and reliability.

HttpClient: A .NET library for making HTTP requests to external APIs and services.

.NET Dependency Injection (DI): A design pattern that allows for decoupling components and managing their dependencies, promoting loose coupling and maintainability.

# Testing Strategy
The project employs a TDD approach, writing tests before implementing code to ensure functionality and quality. Unit tests are utilized to isolate and test individual components of the codebase, while integration tests validate the interactions between components.

# Development Environment
The project is recommended to be developed using Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code, along with the .NET 6 SDK.
